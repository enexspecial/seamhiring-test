<h3>SEAMLESS-HIRING TEST</h3>
<br/>
Create a cart application with Laravel and Vue. The application would do the following:

- -See list of items (should contain the name of the item and price) - a table would be enough for this
- Add an item to cart
- See all items in cart with the total
- Checkout the cart

This application doesn't need to have a functioning api, the cart can be managed by Vuex/Store. It should have very minimal design.
